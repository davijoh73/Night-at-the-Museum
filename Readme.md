# Night at the Museum
This project is part of the Udacity VR Nanodegree program, and is a bit more complex then my previous projects. After researching how VR is changing the travel industry, I was tasked with creating an interactive scene that helps to educate users on what I learned. I chose to create a museum with interactive paintings that display text pop-ups when you click on them. I did my best to create a scene that looks and feels like an actual museum, and tried to use lighting and some visual cues to highlight which exhibits are interactive. You navigate through the museum by clicking on waypoints, which are represented by spinning red gems. There is also a second floor with several additional exhibits and a big window looking outside. I also created a spinning 3D camera object as a bonus exhibit for fun.
