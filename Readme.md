# Night at the Museum
This project is part of the Udacity VR Nanodegree program, and was intended to help students learn how to use iterative testing to continuously check for issues while developing a VR app.  This app also makes use of interactive game objects to allow the user to initiate the puzzle, located inside a small dungeon, as well as to play an interactive memory game.  Once the user completes the puzzle, they then exit the dungeon, and can reset the game if they would like.

## Installation
* If you own an Android phone, you can install the app by simply copying the `NightAtTheMuseum.apk` file from the **Build** directory onto your android device, and installing the apk by clicking on it from the file manager.
* If you own an iPhone, you will need to follow the instructions below for **contributing** to this app, and then switch to the iOS platform in build settings before rebuilding and running on your phone.

## Contributing
You will need to download and install the [Unity Game Engine](https://unity3d.com/), as well as the [Google VR SDK Plugin for Unity](https://developers.google.com/vr/unity/download) to be able to edit this app.  Next, you will need to clone this GitHub repo, and then open `Night at the Museum` in the Unity editor to begin making modifications to the project.
